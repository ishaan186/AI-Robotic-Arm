1. Line no.20 (The code was giving a unknown error without putting [ modelC=1 ])     (This I got to Know from another version of the same library.)
2. line no. 34 (Adding the same to the media pipe function. Without this the same error was appearing.)
3. From line 95 (Adding Self. in the fingers variable or else it was giving a error that variable is not defined. Later on i remebered we had to add that because it was a class and function.)
4. HandType function used from another library.
Some other minute changes are there as well.
